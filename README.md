In this challenge I created a project in Kotlin developing a desktop application with a graphical interface

## ✔️ Technologies

- ``IntelliJ IDE``
- ``Compose Multiplataform``

## :bulb: Project Features

Create a Desktop App that shows the following information about any movie:
- Title
- Poster movie
- Rating
- Year

For this taks I downloaded the poster image and saved ir inside the Resources folder.

- Second Day

For this first sample, I presented the image that was loaded directly from my project. However, when implementing an application that consumes a web API (in this case, with general information about the films), I will have access to the poster images of each film from an HTTP address.

The second day's task will be to load the movie poster image from a URL.

- Third Day

The task will be to customize the look of the movie showing.

During customization, my goal will be to modify colors, font sizes, spacing between visual components, etc.
